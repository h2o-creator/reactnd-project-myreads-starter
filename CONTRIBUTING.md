# Contributing

This project meets with the code specifications at Udacity and provides the enduser with the expected functionality. It also makes use of the BooksAPI provided by Udacity, that means, contributions would be pretty much limited. There are no serious problems or broken features.

However, react might evolve sooner or later, syntax might change, etc. If you can help make something better (without changing any functionality) feel free to create pull requests (make sure to create an issue first).

Please note that pull requests will be inspected before being accepted, because I don't want to change the way the app was intended to work, and I may not have time to check all the pull requests.

Thank you!
